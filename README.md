# Astrophotography Planner
## Overview

The core idea behind this app is to make it easy for astrophotographers to filter through a catalog of deep sky targets
or use an algorithm that chooses the best target for a given night. Each target has a calculated visibility score that measures
what percentage of the night the target is visible for and a season score that measures how close the target is to its opposition
from the sun. The algorithm makes use of both of these scores and information about the moon in order to present the user a list
of possible targets to image. Choose any date or location to get information for.

## Timeline
I concieved the idea for this app in mid-2022 and began working on it in November 2022. From November 2022 through the end of the year,
I taught myself how to program in Swift and use the SwiftUI framework to bring my vision to life. On January 8, 2023 I published a video on youtube
called ["I Created an App for Astrophotography Planning"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEC2_SUVBvc). I had a public beta that I was trying to get
people to join; the app was ready for some initial testing.

I continued adding features, making optimizations, and adjusting it to my vision over the next few months. I kept releasing updates to the public beta
through July. Version 1.0 was released on the app store on July 13, 2023. On October 25, 2023, I released a second YouTube video announcing the release
of the app, called ["My Astrophotography Planning App"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2BWvj2M7jY).

Since then, I've periodically released additional updates. It is currently on version 1.6 (as of 2/20/25).

## Android Version
During the summer of 2024, I began developing an Android version of the app. Learn more [here](https://github.com/ryguy2k4/AstroPlanner_Android).
